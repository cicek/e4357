Answer:

I registered to mbed web site and installed the development environment. 

I exported the “Hello World” program to uVision and gcc ARM embedded. The following files and folders are created:

(a) uVision:

.hg (folder)
mbed (folder)
.hgignore
HelloWorld.uvopt
HelloWorld.uvproj
main.cpp
mbed.bld

In the generated folder for uVision:

There are two xml files that contain the project settings and instructions. These are  
HelloWorld.uvopt and HelloWorld.uvproj. 
HelloWorld.uvopt has 201 lines. HelloWorld.uvproj is 424 lines.
There are 5 object (.o) files and 2 library (.ar) files. The files are in the following location:
mbed/LPC1768/ARM


(b) gcc ARM embedded:

.hg (folder)
mbed (folder)
.hgignore
main.cpp
Makefile
mbed.bld


In the generated folder for gcc ARM:

There is a text file, Makefile. It has 56 lines.     

There are 4 object (.o) files and 2 library (.a) files. The files are in the following location:
mbed/LPC1768/GCC_ARM



The differences between (a) and (b) are:

Project build files are different. uVision has HelloWorld.uvopt and HelloWorld.uvproj while gcc has Makefile. 
The files in ARM folder of uVision and GCC_ARM folder of gcc ARM embedded are different other than the C/C++ Header (.h) files.
