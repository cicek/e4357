7.9 Asynchronous Serial Data Communication

Program Example 7.9 Bidirectional Data transfer between two mbed UARTs.
Work with a classmate as a team for this Program Assignment.  
Connect two mbeds as show in Figure 7.13, and compile and download Program Example 7.9 into each.  You should find that the switches from one mbed control the LEDs from the other, and vice versa.

I read the Chapter 7. First, I did experiment explained in section 7.2.3. In this example, mbed is set as SPI master and it continuously sends 0xA1 (in decimal,161). 
I tested the outputs using the Saleae logic analyzer. I verified that MOSI output has 0xA1 output, and also the clock frequency is 1MHz as set in the code. Also, MSB is sent first. The logic analyzer output can be seen in the following folder in example_7_1.jpg : https://drive.google.com/drive/#folders/0B0LDTU59MYiieTRVSTQweHUtNTQ  

Next, I did I2C communication with temperature sensor experiment. I have TIâ€™s TMP102 temperature sensor breakout board as we use this part in our final project as Group#5.

I tested the outputs by observing the serial terminal with TeraTerm program. The circuit can be seen in example_7_7_circuit.jpg and the output capture is at example_7_7.jpg in the following folder:

I observed that the ambient temperature was around 29.5 Degrees-Celsius. 
I saw that the temperature rose to 32.44 Degrees-Celsius as I press my finger against the sensor after about 10 readings, and slowly drops to the ambient temperature as I withdrew my finger.
